# COVID-19 Data Exploration
This project explores COVID-19 data and visualizes it through a Tableau dashboard.

## Why?
A project to show my ability to explore data with sql and create an engaging visualisation from it. In addition, it aims to answer the following questions:
- Which countries have experienced the COVID-19 pandemic the worst?
- Which countries are receiving the most vaccinations relative to their population?
- How has global/country cases and deaths tracked since the start of the pandemic?

## How?
- COVID-19 data is sourced from ourworldindata.org/coronavirus and was initially split into a covid cases/deaths file ([covid-deaths.xlsx](data_files/covid-deaths.xlsx)) and vaccinations file ([vaccinations.xlsx](data_files/covid-vaccinations.xlsx)) for intial analysis.
- A later update for automatic updates with Python was made, with the data being downloaded first with [covid_data_download.py](covid_data_download.py) to the [covid.db](covid.db) database file and then uploaded to Google Sheets with [covid_data_upload.py](covid_data_upload.py) on a daily basis.
- Dataset is then vizualised in Tableau in the [COVID-19 dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/GlobalCOVID-19CasesDeathsandVaccinationsTracker/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link), highlighting global cases, deaths and vaccination rates.
- Note: Python can handle the data transformation and storage without and SQL database, however, to showcase my SQL ability it has been included.
